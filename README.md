# hi, i'm anna. 

i'm from the Ã¦ther, but currently reside in las vegas, though 
planning to be mobile july 2022 and through 2023.

i'm interested in radios, rfid, nfc, & emv, reverse engineering, 
and too many other things to list. 

i'm fluent in all things cloud. <3 gcp and aws. love serverless.
i've been playing a bit lately with aws connect and twilio on some
telephony projects.

i mostly write code in python3 these days with some c, shell, 
and html/css (and sure a little javascript for good measure.)
sometimes i play around with lua and rust too. 

i'm flexible as far as what my workstation looks like, but generally
i'm most efficient if it looks like this:

- kali linux or ubuntu (with andrax)
- [awesome wm](https://awesomewm.org/) as window manager
- ides: pycharm, atom, and vim
- terminal: qterminal
- file manager: nemo
